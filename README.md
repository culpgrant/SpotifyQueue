# Spotify Add Songs to Queue: Project Overview
This is a [webisite](https://partyqueue.herokuapp.com/) hosted on Heroku using Flask that allows people to submit a Spotify Songs URL and add it to the queue of my device. 

## Motivation: 
This project was originalyl thought of when I was hosting a birthday party for my girlfiend. I wanted a way for people to be able to hear their favorite songs without me having to ask if they wanted to hear anything specific.

## Code Resources:
- **Python Version:** 3.8
- **Packages:** [spotipy](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.16.1/), [flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/), [WTForms](https://wtforms.readthedocs.io/en/2.3.x/)

## Intended Use:
- This project will only add songs to my queue for my spotify device when I have the correct device on. It is mainly to share the code in case someone else wants to achomplish this for their own spotify.
